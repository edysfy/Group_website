            <p class="boxText">
                EmoteMap exists to help address the global epidemic
                of mental health issues. Inspired by our desire to share
                emotions, EmoteMap helps you to connect with others
                around the globe. Here's an example scenario that demonstrates
                how EmoteMap works:
                <br>
                <br>
                Let's say your government has announced another national
                lockdown. You may start to feel less positive, and isolated.
                You open up EmoteMap to make a post. You submit your
                happiness rating (1-5), and the reason as to why you are
                feeling how you are. EmoteMap will pin your anonymous post
                to the globe, and will show you the pins and posts of others
                who have reported similar levels of happiness and for similar
                reasons. Furthermore, you can search pins and posts by keywords,
                allowing you to see trends across the world.
                <br>
                <br>
                The idea is to remind users that they are never alone in their
                feelings. We currently live in a world that is dominated by a type
                of social media that thrives on boastfulness and desire. EmoteMap
                strives to be the opposite: to connect people based on real,
                non-hidden emotion.
                <br>
                <br>
                You are not alone...
