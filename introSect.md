### Abstract
TO FINISH DO ABSTRACT....

### Objectives
 - Create a writing tool that allows self-reflection in a similar way to blogging and journaling.  
 - Create a peer-led support network where users can interact with each other as a community.      
 - Create a tool that raises awareness and information through a visual heat-map based on an accumulation of users' mental health in different geolocations.

## Who is our Target Market & Stakeholders?
The end user our team seeks to attain to is any male or female on the planet who has access to the Internet over the age of 13.  Please see Sarah's fictional user story in our [UX section](uxDesign.md) where we talk about our end users in more detail, including Sarah's fictional user story which serves as an example of a way in which we aim for users to interact with EmoteMap. There are *X* number of people in our target population. When it came to evaluating exactly how users interpreted our designs throughout the development process we found, through [Smart Survey's sample size calculator](https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/sample-size-calculator), our required sample size  for a target population of this size was *X*. Please see our Limitations heading of the [Evaluation section](evalSect.md) for a more in depth discussion about the sample size of our market.    

Our team aimed to address two key stakeholders:    
Our first was the type of end user that made up our target market, as explained above. Second would be any analyst or organisation who would benefit from the data provided by EmoteMap about the different emotions and experiences felt globally. This could be in the form of visual data provided by our heat map, data extracted from the experiences and emotions logged by users; either as part of their blog post, the keyword emotion that they chose to log (e.g - "anxious"), user geolocation, or the 1-3 scale of emotion logged by the user. We envisage this kind of stakeholder to be a data analyst or a mental health organisation for example. For a more detailed investigation into this type of stakeholder, please see Christina's fictional story in our [UX section](uxDesign.md) which can help you visualise exactly how this kind of stakeholder would benefit from using EmoteMap.

# The Problem: Background and Motivation
### The Problem
Our team addresses both the problem of poor  mental health globally and the inadequacy of today's mainstream social media in addressing it. To make the problem more digestible we decided to define it in two parts. In the first, we explain the issue of poor mental health which has become significantly worse as a result of the global lockdown. In the second we address the related issue of online culture's inadequacy to acknowledge the first problem. Current mainstream social platforms found online can be ,in fact, detrimental to it.

### The First Part of the Problem: Mental illness globally
Our team seeks to address the problem of mental illness globally. We do not believe that you can define mental illness simply as sadness or insanity. It is not a binary or exclusive concept in this way. Rather, we see it as a complex and universal problem. A time series curated by the Institute for Health Metrics Evaluation demonstrates that in a recent year about 13% of the global population suffered from some kind of mental disorder (Guardian, 2011). The British charity, Mind, refers to a statistic that one in four people will experience some form of mental illness in a given year  (Mind, 2020). Over in America it has been noted by the Anxiety and Depression Association of America that anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the US, effecting 40 million adults aged 18 and older (ADAA, 2021). Ironically, although anxiety is highly treatable only 36.9% of those suffering receive treatment (ADAA, 2021).  

We view mental illness as a global phenomenon, experienced in different ways around the world. For example, the incidence of catastrophic healthcare expenditure in Mexican households caring for a person with a mental disorder (Castro et. al, 2020) is not a naturally relatable topic for someone experiencing depression in the UK. At the same time, those Mexicans suffering from catastrophic healthcare expenditure will find it hard share similar coping mechanisms with Syrians dealing with mental distress in ongoing conflict and non-conflict settings during COVID-19. Emotemap seeks to unite people experiencing this universal and complex phenomenon at a local level, whereby users can find people going through similar experiences and emotions by searching for a keyword or looking in a certain location.

This part of the problem is particularly prominent today as a result of lockdown and social distancing measures. 60% of adults and 68% of young people have said their mental health has worsened during lockdown (Mind, 2020). In addition to this many who have never previously experienced mental health problems have seen their mental health and wellbeing decline during lockdown (Mind, 2020).

### The Second Part of the Problem: Current online societies are detrimental to mental health
The compulsive use of social media amongst our population is increasing. By 2022 it is forecast that there will be 3 billion active monthly users of social media and therefore has become an integral part of society. As our lives become more heavily dependant on online culture, the impact that it has on our mental health is exacerbated.  

Mainstream social platforms are detrimental to humans' mental health. Harris and Pettman believe that algorithms in mainstream social media platforms hijack our psychological vulnerabilities and exploit our minds' weaknesses by playing to our emotional disposition of seeking social reassurance (Harris, 2016). On the surface, social media appears to be ultra-social and therefore we use it in the hope that it will make us feel less alone. However, after continued use it becomes evident that each user has their own inner life, which we are not part of. Through noticing this users receive a strong 'rebound loneliness' (Pettman, 2016:20). In agreement with this, according to a new Cigna study, 7 out of 10 heavy social media users reported feelings of loneliness (Cigna, 2008).  

Harris agrees with this, arguing that our social approval is in the hands of tech companies (Harris, 2016) due to their emotionally addictive nature. In this way, social media can be likened to gambling due to the issue of instant gratification (Song et. al, 2004). Dopamine, which increases the general of goal-directed behaviour, is released when checking social media. Therefore, the use of manipulative algorithms in mainstream social media platforms account for the powerful emotional attachment of many users. This kind of emotional addiction leads to detrimental impacts on humans such as low self-esteem. The Royal Society of Public Health recently found that 9 in 10 females say that they are unhappy with the way they look (Edmonds, 2008).

As a result of this developing dependency on social media we believe that it is our duty to learn to find new and more positive ways of interacting with each other in order to attain to our mental health. Barak and Grohol bring to light that two thirds of all people with diagnosable mental disorders do not seek treatment and therefore internet-based interventions provide the outreach dimension that mental health services have always sought (Barak & Grohol, 2011). We believe that by encouraging a culture of sharing experiences and emotions, and therefore the way in which we use online platforms as a communications modality, people can feel less inhibited which may encourage self-reflection and healing.  

See the next section where we discover how blogging and online peer-led support groups can help solve this problem.  

### How can blogging for self-reflection and online peer-led support groups solve the problem?
Scheff is a sociologist who has emphasised that unresolved emotional distress gives rise to neurotic patterns of behaviour that can be dissipated by catharsis in the form of writing or blogging (Scheff, 1979). This brings to light that the re-experiencing of distressful emotions through writing can uncover the unconscious source of emotional distress and lead to an improvement in attitude and behaviour. In agreement with this, Ulrich and Lutgendorf argue that writing about trauma with focus on cognition and emotions associated with that trauma allows people to develop greater awareness of the positive benefits that have come from that situation (Ulrich & Lutgendorf, 2002).  

Barak and Grohol have brought to light that online peer-led support groups have existed since the 1980s (Barak & Grohol, 2011). They believe that not all mental health interventions need explicitly professional or psychotherapeutic techniques. In a similar way to EmoteMap, mutual self-help support groups rely on individuals to provide asynchronous general emotional support and information to one another, generally without a professional’s intervention or guidance (Barak & Grohol, 2011). Online peer-led groups appear to be equally effective as information providing websites. This is exemplified by Freemen, whose 2009 study involved the analysis of 238 college students's interactions with online websites and mutual support groups. One of the two groups only viewed websites with information about student problems whilst the other had additional access to an online mutual support group. The latter group improved both in terms of well-being and satisfaction with life (Barak & Grohol, 2011).   

In agreement with this, Bakar and Moore did a study on MySpace and discovered that those users who blogged frequently increased their social integration and friendship satisfaction scores compared to those who did not (Bakar & Moore, 2008).

# EmoteMap Will Solve the Problem by...
### 1) Introducing a more positive way for users to interact online
We are not trying to reduce the interaction that humans have with online social platforms, it is clear that this will inevitably increase in forthcoming years. Instead, we want to create an aspect to online sociality that is similar in interactivity to current mainstream social media platforms but addresses mental health explicitly.

### 2) Creating an environment whereby users can be both self-reflective and feel supported by a community of users
Blogs offer mental health intervention in a similar way to journaling. Although journalling has traditional been done in private to complement psychology, blogging has taken many would-be private journals and turned them public (Bakar & Moore, 2008). Feedback from others can help an individual learn to view feelings and thoughts in ways differently to how they would if they were left to their own devices.

### 3) Solving a global problem locally
The complexity of the issue of global mental illness means that there is no universal solution. We also acknowledge that those suffering mentally may be doing so due to culturally dependant reasons. Therefore, a teacher facing stress, anxiety and depressing at the beginning of the academic year during the COVID-19 pandemic (Santamaría & Mondragon, 2021) may search keywords such as 'stress, anxiety, teachers, COVID'. The posts they read will most likely be completely different to those of someone experiencing intimate partner violence and unhealthy alcohol use in the Zambia (Kane et. al, 2021).

### 4) Empowering non-users with relevant data
We seek to empower analysts and organisations with data that will aid them in their efforts to combat the issue of mental illness globally. This will be an indirect contribution to solving the problem. For example, a charity could raise awareness for mental illness by showcasing visual data taken from EmoteMap's heat map interface which would allow for a comprehensive explanation of how many people feel depressed in certain areas.

# Industry Review: What Differentiates EmoteMap?
#### Website 1 - The Mental Elf
##### Summary:
The Mental Elf is a 'no misinformation' mental health blogging website started by information scientist, Andre Tomlin. The blog is now a team of contributors aiming to bring fresh perspectives, considerable knowledge, and clinical experience when talking about mental health.  

##### How EmoteMap solves the problem differently:
Although The Mental Elf's enlightening information can provide those trying to understand their mental health better the relevant knowledge, Emote Map aims to build more of a positive way for users to interact online. We aim to create a communal feel, whereby users can both be self-reflective as well as feel supported by other users who have had similar experiences and emotions.


#### Website 2 - Young Minds
##### Summary:
YoungMinds has partnered with 02 to gather tips and advise on how to enjoy a more positive time online. They work to tackle issues such as 'What kind of social media feed do I have?', 'How can I deal with online bullying?', or 'How can I block, mute, or report other accounts?'  

##### How EmoteMap solves the problem differently:  
Although YoungMinds is explicitly addressing the negative impact that social media can have on the mental health of users, EmoteMap provides guidance to users for a variety of issues. We understand that a major contributing factor to poor mental health is the use of social media, however we account for more factors than just this. We understand that global mental illness does not have a quick-fix. It is a complex and universal problem, which is why we encourage groups of users to unite over shared cultural and topical issues.


#### Website 3 - The Mighty
##### Summary:
The Mighty publish real stories by real people living with disability, disease and mental illness. They aim to build a safe platform for their community to share stories, connect with others and raise support for the causes they believe in.

##### How EmoteMap solves the problem differently:
The Mighty are building a positive online community in the same way that we seek to. We see light in this, as EmoteMap makes the user the heart of the website too. They themselves are a great starting point when it comes to solving the problem of global health mentally. However, Emote Map's encapsulating map interface enables the user to gain a localised understanding of a very much  global problem in a way that The Mighty does not. EmoteMap strives to engage the user through its map interface in order to create a positive environment for users to communicate.
