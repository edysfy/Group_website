Title : EmoteMap  

Demo Map layout idea
![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

What is the serious element?
Addressing the global epidemic of mental health issues. We will highlight the scale of the problem, and encourage solidarity (i.e., by reading other user posts reporting similar emotions and reasoning). By reporting a mood, coupled with a phrase of reason, the above will be achieved. Users can also scan a globe to expose situations happening in other areas, potentially providing an insight to the cause and effect of mental health/low mood - e.g. showing the sentiment in an area changing as the result of an event such as COVID lockdown measures.
1- allows user to reflect on their individual experiences (personal diary)
2- allows users to communicate with each other on shared experiences (social media)
3 – allows for a general sense of cause and effect of mental health to be understood by (heat map)

# Introduction 
•	Abstract. Motivation for the project, framing of the problem and a high-level overview of the system.  
•	Project Objectives. The high level goals of the project and the contribution towards solving the problem. A checklist against which the team can evaluate their success.  
•	Video. Short (1-2min) - demo video to explain your system (think Kickstarter). 



### Abstract

(re-do this at the very end) During lockdown there has been an increase in mental health issues and isolation amongst people. We sought to address this problem by developing a communal/global map that allows users to pin and write logs about how they feel at certain times and locations. If a user is not logged in or authenticated they can only see that map and read posts but not create or edit posts. Once the user logs in they can select a location during the day and vent their thoughts at a particular location. There will be a timeline function where the user can choose to see what they wrote about across time and space. The users pins will be different from other users so they can distinguish them. This effectively acts as an interactive diary. Users can also comment on other posts to give a sense of community {enter how community aids happiness}. There will also be a search bar that allows users/non-users to search for key terms and display pins/posts across the global relating to that term. This application is a fun way to allow users to vent and communicate with others while allowing people to view trends of emotional state across the globe, which helps with loneliness and brings awareness to mental health topics.


### Objectives 
1 - Create a writing tool that allows self-reflection in a similar way to blogging.  
2 - Create a peer-led support network where users can interact with each other as a community.    
3 - Create a tool that raises awareness and information through a visual heat-map based on an accumulation of users' mental health in different geolocations.

## Background and Motivation
What are you going to make?
(what features will your project have/technical challenges)
An interface of the globe, with the option for the user to enter their emotional state/happiness level, a keyword phrase describing why they are feeling the way they are, and an optional section for a more detailed blog/diary post. The page will then display (perhaps using a heatmap?) the different mood levels across the globe (or maybe initially localised to Bristol), with the option to click on an area and see the most common keywords to provide insight as to why the sentiment is at the current level (and to see individual blog posts) - perhaps almost creating the basis of a social media type system?
To keep the individual interested, whenever they make a submission, they receive feedback on the number of others who are feeling similar who have submitted the same/similar keyword(s).
As an extension could allow to search for key terms?
(are we using external API/database?)
Api for user location tracking?
We can use an api to display the globe. Will need a database to store user profile data, user posts, and stats about certain key words/happy distribution.
